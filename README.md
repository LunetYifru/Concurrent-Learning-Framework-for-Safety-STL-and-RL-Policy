Concurrent Learning of Control Policy and Unknown Constraints in Reinforcement Learning

This repository contains the code accompanying the journal submission paper on the Concurrent Learning Framework. It implements a novel approach leveraging advancements in real-time assurance monitoring, optimization, and safety in robotic systems. This project is built on Python 3.10 and utilizes a Conda environment for managing dependencies and ensuring compatibility across systems.

Dependencies
The codebase depends on several key libraries, including modified versions of Safety Gymnasium and Omnisafe, tailored to meet the specific objectives of this research. The dependencies are as follows:

`rtamt`
`GPyOpt (with GPy)`
`Modified Safety_gymnasium`
`Modified Omnisafe`
